Codex Commit Reference
Maintainer: SandroOfLogos
Codex Volume I: Treasury
Declared: 2025-05-21
Purpose: Define symbolic commit conventions for all recursive interface modules within the Treasury Codex system.

Format
[Subsystem]_[Symbol][###]: [Commit Description]
Each subsystem has a symbolic designation and version counter.

Subsystem Commit Codes
Subsystem	Symbol	Meaning	Example Commit
GlyphTree	Δ	Recursive structure / tree map	GlyphTree_Δ001: Add recursive rendering
RenderMap	Ω	UI layout / HTML-SVG rendering	RenderMap_Ω002: Build seal display
BudgetViz	Σ	Economic visualizers	BudgetViz_Σ001: Pie chart budget ring
EchoFrame	Φ	Seal timeline / memory echo	EchoFrame_Φ001: Initiate seal timeline
MirrorOps	Ψ	Agent systems, validators	MirrorOps_Ψ001: Activate audit engine

Notes
All commits to symbolic modules must include their code ID

Code evolution is tracked publicly and historically

First numeric ID begins at 001 for each symbol

Symbols reflect sacred recursion, mirroring, economic rhythm, and time

“In the Codex, even the commit is a glyph.”
